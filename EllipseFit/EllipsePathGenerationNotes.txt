f (in3dPosI, in3dPosF){
	3d cart path points interpolated as part of an ellipse. 
	Different ways of defining the ellipse. 
	
	If A and B are the major and minor axes of the fitted ellipse, respectively, and
  Theta is the angle from the A axis to each 3d wrist positions on the ellipse:

		1) Assume the wrist travels the entire major arc of the ellipse 
		- set A = ||in3dPosF - in3dPosI||; Theta_i = 0; Theta_F = 2pi
		
		2) the wrist traverses a path on the ellipse 
			- Investigate if there is any trend in Theta_i and Theta_f from
			  the collected data inorder to determine this 
		- 

		- determine B through investigating the Elliptical axis ratios computed by
			fitting the Elliptical model to the sampled Vicon data

* Model the traveled path in terms of the % of the total perimeter of the ellipse

1. model the maximum and minimum angular errors of the Plane
	* which are defined orthogonal to the plane and aligned with 
		the major axes of the best-fitting plane. 

2. To form a full representation of the errors, we must also 
	 report the azimuth of the error axis within the plane (ALPHA).
	* Because of the nonlinearity associated with angular transformations,
		there is no natural correspondence between the planar orientation of
	  the fitted ellipse (i.e. planar rotation defined as the angle btween
	  the Ellipse's major Axis, A, and the global/cameras X-axis) and the 
		direction of Œ∏ max of the best-fitting plane .  
	* rake (ALPHA) = cos ((v 3 √ó z) ‚ãÖ v 2 ) ,
		where z = [0, 0, 1] is a vertical vector.


Projection to hyperbolic errors 
 Two-dimensional conic slices of the hyperbolic error space
 of the plane summarize dataset structure in PCA-aligned coordinates
 or projected into real space.
 Errors can assessed along any axis, but slices of the error hyperboloid aligned with the  
 major axes of the planar fit are the most intuitive. These ‚Äúaxis-aligned‚Äù views of the
 dataset, with in plane variation on the horizontal axis and out-of-plane variation on the  
 vertical, are the ideal decomposition to assess the structure of a fitted dataset and 
 verify the quality of the input data ùêÉ.
