WARNING: Logging before InitGoogleLogging() is written to STDERR
W1123 09:40:54.155947 25147 residual_block.cc:131] 

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.  

Residuals:             -nan         -nan         -nan         -nan         -nan         -nan         -nan         -nan         -nan         -nan         -nan         -nan

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.

W1123 09:40:54.804425 25147 residual_block.cc:131] 

Error in evaluating the ResidualBlock.

There are two possible reasons. Either the CostFunction did not evaluate and fill all    
residual and jacobians that were requested or there was a non-finite value (nan/infinite)
generated during the or jacobian computation. 

Residual Block size: 2 parameter blocks x 12 residuals

For each parameter block, the value of the parameters are printed in the first column   
and the value of the jacobian under the corresponding residual. If a ParameterBlock was 
held constant then the corresponding jacobian is printed as 'Not Computed'. If an entry 
of the Jacobian/residual array was requested but was not written to by user code, it is 
indicated by 'Uninitialized'. This is an error. Residuals or Jacobian values evaluating 
to Inf or NaN is also an error.
